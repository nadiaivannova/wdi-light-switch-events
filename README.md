The Switch

Given the HTML and CSS as provided, use JavaScript to hear the click of the switch and meet the following criteria:

1. When someone hits the button in the switch, remove the current state class (on/off), and apply the opposite class (on/off)

2. Swap the colors of the body's background and text by adding or removing the dark/light class

3. Lastly, change the text in box to say "It's so bright in here!" when it's on, and "Hey, who turned off the lights?" when it's off
Hints

Start with small steps:

- Change the status text when the document is ready
- Add a click listener to the switch and incorporate the changes listed above in 'Your Assignment'
- Confirm the switch works
- How do we switch the classes back now?
- use an if statement to change the text
- you should be able to click the switch many times and it should switch back and forth between light and dark modes
